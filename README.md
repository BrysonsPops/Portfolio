# Portfolio
Hello world! I am a leader with years of experience coordinating with teams to achieve the desired results of customer service centric businesses. I am charismatic and empathetic , with a talent for teaching and motivating others. Over the course of my professional career I have owned what it means to be a team player through polishing my skills in communication , collaboration , and commitment to my team and our goals. I look forward to applying my passion for helping others to a career in tech by helping organizations maintain a healthy security life cycle and mitigate risk to their company and client's private data. What is fulfilling to me is knowing that each day I am contributing to a safer online experience for users. More importantly, what I value the most in my life are my personal relationships with my friends and family.  

Welcome to my portfolio.
